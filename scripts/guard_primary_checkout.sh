# Operationalises spec/project/parallel-working-copies/
# §Branch-to-worktree mapping: "MUST keep the primary checkout on
# `develop` at all times" and "MUST perform every change ... in a
# dedicated worktree; the primary checkout MUST NOT be switched off
# `develop` onto a feature branch". The spec is Implementation:
# documentary-only and its §Open Questions deferred a mechanical guard
# until a drift incident was recorded; that incident happened (the
# primary checkout was found sitting on a `docs/` feature branch), so
# this hook closes the loophole for the most common failure mode:
# committing feature work directly in the primary checkout.
#
# Self-detection: the hook is installed once in the shared hooks dir and
# therefore also fires inside linked worktrees. Worktrees are the
# *correct* place for feature-branch commits, so the guard exits 0 in any
# linked worktree and only enforces the rule in the primary checkout,
# distinguished by git-dir == git-common-dir.

✖ Primary checkout is on $state, not 'develop' — commit blocked.

  The primary checkout ($(pwd -P)) is for integration only and MUST stay
  on 'develop' at all times (spec/project/parallel-working-copies/
  §Branch-to-worktree mapping). Feature work — feat/ fix/ chore/ docs/
  exp/ — happens in a dedicated worktree that branches off develop.

  Repair the drift instead of committing here:

    # 1. park the current feature work in its own worktree
    git switch develop
    git worktree add "\${NOLTE_WORKTREE_ROOT:-~/repos/.worktrees}/claude-shared/<slug>" $branch
    #    (or, for a fresh branch off develop: task worktree:add -- $branch)

    # 2. restore the primary checkout to the remote tip
    git fetch origin develop && git merge --ff-only origin/develop

  Then re-run your commit from inside the worktree.
